# DDoS Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a predictive analysis model for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques. The model leverages historical network traffic data to identify patterns indicative of DDoS attacks and provides a real-time prediction API.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict DDoS attacks based on network traffic data. The project includes:

1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
3. Evaluation of model performance.
4. A Flask API for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **XGBoost**: Advanced gradient boosting library for performance improvement.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the API.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading models.
- **PyYAML**: For reading configuration files.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or any other suitable source. It should contain various features of network traffic, including labels indicating whether the traffic is part of a DDoS attack or normal traffic.

Place the raw dataset in the `data/raw/` directory and ensure the filename is `ddos_data.csv`.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a structured directory format for better organization:

# ddos-detection
# ddos-detection-project
